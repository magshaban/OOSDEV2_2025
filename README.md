# Advanced Object-Oriented Software Development 2

## Lecturer Information
**Dr. Maged Shaban, PhD**  
Lecturer at the School of Enterprise Computing and Digital Transformation  
Technological University Dublin  
Email: maged.shaban[at]tudublin.ie

## Course Overview
This course focuses on **advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts** using C# and Java. It builds upon oo programming principles, covering topics such as **inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, generics, data structures, algorithm analysis, and concurrency**. The course includes **both theoretical discussions and practical coding examples** to ensure students gain a strong grasp of modern software development practices.

## Course Organization
The course is divided into different lectures, each focusing on a core topic. Each lecture provides:
- **Key theoretical concepts**
- **Code demonstrations**
- **Practical applications**
- **Hands-on exercises/Computer Labs (10)**
- **CAs (3)**

**Additionally, there are dedicated computer lab sessions** (2 hours per week) where students can practice coding exercises and receive guidance from instructors/tutor. For more details, please refer to the course information on Brightspace.

**Note: All materials are provided in C#. Translating the code to Java is an exercise for students to enhance their learning experience, under the supervision of the instructor.**
