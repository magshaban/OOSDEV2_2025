### Lecture 10: Data Structures and Sorting Algorithms in C#

#### Overview
This lecture covers Advanced **Data Structures** and **Sorting Algorithms** in object-oriented software development using C#. It provides implementations and analyses of commonly used structures like **linked lists**, **binary search trees**, and **sorting algorithms** such as **bubble sort** and **selection sort**.

#### Key Concepts
- **Linked Lists**: Understanding singly linked lists, including insertion, removal, and traversal operations.
- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**: Exploring BST properties, insertion, and in-order traversal.
- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - **Bubble Sort**: A simple, but inefficient sorting algorithm with O(n²) complexity.
  - **Selection Sort**: Another O(n²) sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element in each pass.
- **Binary Search**: Efficient searching technique with O(log n) complexity.

#### Files
- `LinkedListDemo.cs`: Implements a singly linked list with operations such as `AddFirst`, `AddLast`, `Remove`, and `Traverse`.
- `BinarySearch.cs`: Implements binary search, showcasing the divide-and-conquer approach.
- `BubbleSort.cs`: Implements bubble sort and tracks comparisons and swaps.
- `SelectionSort.cs`: Implements selection sort, displaying sorting progress and comparisons.
- `Palindrome.cs`: Uses recursion to check if a given string is a palindrome.
- `BinarySearchTree_Demo.cs`: Implements a generic binary search tree supporting insertion and in-order traversal.
