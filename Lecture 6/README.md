### Lecture 6: Anonymous Classes, Lambda Expressions, and Delegates

#### Overview
This lecture covers anonymous classes, lambda expressions, and delegates in C#. These features provide enhanced flexibility, allowing for dynamic object creation, concise function definitions, and efficient method referencing.

#### Key Concepts
- **Anonymous Classes**: Learn how to define objects without explicitly declaring a class, useful for quick data structures and LINQ projections.
- **Lambda Expressions**: Understand how lambda expressions provide concise syntax for writing inline functions and expressions.
- **Delegates**: Explore how delegates enable passing methods as parameters, supporting event-driven programming and flexible callbacks.

#### Files
- `1_AnonymousClass_Demo.cs`: Demonstrates the use of anonymous classes to create objects on the fly without defining a formal class structure.
- `2_Lambda_example_demo.cs`: Shows how to define and use lambda expressions for concise function definitions, including `Action` and `Func` examples.
- `3_Delegate_Demo_1.cs`: Introduces basic delegate usage, where a delegate (`PrintMessage`) is used to reference and call a method.
- `3_Delegate_Demo_2.cs`: Expands on delegate functionality, showing how methods can be assigned to delegates, invoked dynamically, and even replaced with lambda expressions.
