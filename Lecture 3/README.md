### Lecture 3: Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Interfaces

#### Overview
This lecture covers fundamental object-oriented programming concepts: inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces. These principles are essential for building flexible and reusable code structures.

#### Key Concepts
- **Inheritance**: Learn how a class can inherit from another class to promote code reuse and establish a hierarchical relationship between classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Understand how polymorphism allows a single interface to be used for different types, enabling dynamic method invocation.
- **Interfaces**: Explore how interfaces define contracts for classes, allowing multiple classes to share common behaviors without enforcing a strict inheritance hierarchy.

#### Files
- `1_InheritanceDemo.cs`: Demonstrates how inheritance works in C# by creating a base class (`Person`) and a derived class (`Musician`).
- `2_PolymorphismDemo.cs`: Shows how polymorphism allows different types of mammals (`Dog`, `Cat`) to implement common behaviors in different ways.
- `3_InterfaceDemo.cs`: Explains the use of interfaces by implementing an `IDrawable` interface in the `Circle` class to enforce a contract for drawable objects.
