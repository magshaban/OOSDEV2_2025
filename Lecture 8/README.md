### Lecture 8: Nullable Reference Types, Recursion, and Concurrency in C#

#### Overview
This lecture delves into essential concepts in contemporary C# programming, focusing on nullable reference types, recursion, and concurrency. These topics are crucial for writing robust, efficient, and maintainable code. By understanding and applying these concepts, developers can enhance program reliability, optimize performance, and effectively manage complex computational tasks.

#### Key Concepts
- **Nullable Reference Types**: Introduces nullable reference types, enabling better null safety and reducing runtime exceptions.
- **Recursion**: Demonstrates recursive function calls, including power calculations and factorial computations.
- **Concurrency & Parallelism**: Explores multi-threading and asynchronous programming in C# to improve performance by executing tasks concurrently.

#### Files
- `1_NullableReferenceType_DEMO.cs`: Demonstrates the use of nullable reference types and compiler warnings when working with null values.
- `2_Recursion_DEMO1.cs`: Implements a recursive function to calculate powers of a number (`x^n`), including base cases and error handling.
- `2_Recursion_DEMO2.cs`: Provides a recursive approach to computing factorials, handling valid and invalid inputs.
- `3_Concurrency Parallelism_DEMO1.cs`: Shows basic multi-threading using the `Thread` class to run tasks concurrently.
- `3_Concurrency Parallelism_DEMO2.cs`: Demonstrates the use of `Task` and `async/await` for asynchronous programming, allowing non-blocking execution.
- `3_Concurrency Parallelism_DEMO3.cs`: Implements asynchronous count-up and count-down tasks running in parallel with `Task.WhenAll`.
