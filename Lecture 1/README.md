# Lecture 1: Object-Oriented Programming - Software Development 2

## Overview
This lecture delves into the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#. The accompanying project provides practical examples and code implementations to solidify these concepts.

## Key Concepts
- **Classes & Objects**: Learn about the creation and usage of `Person`, `Student`, and `Teacher` classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Understand how to implement properties to control data access, such as `Name`, `Age`, `Major`, and `Subject`.
- **Constructors**: Explore different ways to initialize objects using constructors.
- **Methods**: Discover the use of instance methods like `Info` and static methods like `ClassInfo`.
- **Inheritance**: See how `Student` and `Teacher` classes inherit from the `Person` class, demonstrating the concept of inheritance.
- **Polymorphism**: Observe method overriding in derived classes to understand polymorphism.
