# Lecture 1: Object-Oriented Programming - Software Development 2

## Overview
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C#.

## Key Concepts
- **Classes & Objects**: Defines `Person`, `Student`, and `Teacher` classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Uses properties for controlled data access (`Name`, `Age`, `major`, `Subject`).
- **Constructors**: Provides multiple ways to initialize objects.
- **Methods**: Includes instance (`Info`) and static (`ClassInfo`) methods.
- **Inheritance**: `Student` and `Teacher` inherit from `Person`.
- **Polymorphism**: Overrides methods in child classes.

## Program Flow
1. Creates and initializes instances of `Person`, `Student`, and `Teacher`.
2. Demonstrates property assignments and method calls.
3. Uses static methods for class-level info.

## Expected Output
The program prints information about different persons, students, and teachers.
