### Lecture 2: Advanced OOP Concepts

#### Overview
This lecture covers advanced OOP concepts such as access modifiers, abstract classes, sealed classes, and static members. These concepts are crucial for designing robust and maintainable object-oriented software.

#### Key Concepts
- **Access Modifiers**: Understand the different access levels (public, private, protected, internal, protected internal, private protected) and their usage. Learn how to control the visibility and accessibility of class members.
- **Abstract Classes**: Learn about abstract classes and methods, and how to derive classes from them. Understand when to use abstract classes to define a common interface for a group of related classes.
- **Sealed Classes**: Explore the concept of sealed classes and methods to prevent further inheritance or overriding. Understand scenarios where sealing a class or method is beneficial.
- **Static Members**: Discover the use of static fields, methods, and classes. Learn how to use static members to share data and behavior across all instances of a class.

#### Project Structure
- **1_autoImplementationDemo.cs**: Demonstrates auto-implemented properties, which simplify property declarations.
- **2_PublicPrivateProtected_Ex1.cs**: Examples of different access modifiers, showing how to control access to class members.
- **3_PublicPrivateProtected_Ex2.cs**: More examples of access modifiers, providing additional context and usage scenarios.
- **4_SealedDemo.cs**: Demonstrates the use of sealed classes to prevent inheritance.
- **4_SealedDemo2.cs**: Demonstrates the use of sealed methods to prevent overriding.
- **5_AbstractDemo.cs**: Examples of abstract classes and methods, showing how to define and implement abstract members.
- **6_StaticClassDemo.cs**: Demonstrates the use of static classes, which cannot be instantiated.
- **6_StaticMembersDemo.cs**: Examples of static fields and methods, illustrating how to use static members to share data and behavior.
