### Lecture 9: Algorithm Analysis and Binary Search in C#

#### Overview
This lecture covers fundamental concepts in algorithm analysis and the implementation of **Binary Search** in C#. Algorithm analysis provides a way to evaluate efficiency in terms of time and space complexity. Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently finds an element in a sorted array.

#### Key Concepts
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Understanding time complexity, Big-O notation, and efficiency comparisons of different algorithms (on Brightspace).
- **Binary Search**: Implementing and analyzing an efficient search algorithm for sorted arrays.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Learning how binary search repeatedly divides the problem in half, making it faster than linear search.

#### Files
- `Program.cs`: Demonstrates the binary search algorithm with various test cases, showcasing successful and unsuccessful searches.
- `BinSearch.cs`: Implements the **Binary Search Algorithm**, providing step-by-step visual output of the search process, including midpoints and search boundaries.
